#  Authentication

!> IMPORTANT: This is not live. We will make an announcement about it when it is live.

Starting from version TBD, all API requests must be accompanied by a developer key. This key is a unique identifier to an individual developer and you should not share it with anyone else.

## Key Management

###  Generating new keys

You can obtain and manage your developer key on [our discord server](http://discord.me/cr_api).

1. Go to the #developer-key channel.
2. Type `!crapikey get`
3. The bot will send you a DM (direct message) with your key.

###  Forgotten keys

To get a reminder of your developer key, visit the Discord channel above and type `!crapikey get` again and the bot will remind you a DM again.

### Removing keys

If you feel that your key may have been compromised, you may remove it and obtain a new one.

1. Go to the #developer-key channel.
2. Type `!crapikey remove` or `!crapikey rm`
3. The bot will acknowledge your request if it is successful.

## Key Activation

1. Once issued, your key will be active.
2. Your developer key will remain active as long as you remain a user on our Discord server. Your key will be automatically disabled once you have left the server.

## API Abuse

We reserve the right to permanently blacklist keys / developers who have been shown to abuse the API with requests.
