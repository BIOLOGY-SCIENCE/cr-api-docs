# Introduction

<img width="30%" height="30%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cr-api/cr-api-docs/master/docs/img/cr-api-logo-b.png">

Welcome to the Clash Royale API! You can use our API to access Clash Royale API endpoints, which can get information about Clash Royale. At the moment, you can access clan information but we are working on retrieving player profiles and battle logs in the future.

You can see an implementation of this API on our web site: http://cr-api.com

We recommend that you search the issue tracker to check if someone else has already reported the issue and whether there is a known solution that you can use. This probably is the fastest way for you to find a solution to any issue that you are facing.

If you are adding a bug report, please add steps to reproduce the bug, exact request (method and URL) and response (including response code). Any additional information (console errors, screenshots) would be helpful.
