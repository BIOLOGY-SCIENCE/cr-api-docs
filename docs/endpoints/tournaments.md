# Tournaments

The tournaments endpoint is not overly useful unless you know the tournament tags already. It is not possible to search for tournaments nor see a list of open tournaments at the moment. Please donâ€™t storm our Github and Discord to ask for them.

You can see information about the tournament before it has started and after it has ended.
