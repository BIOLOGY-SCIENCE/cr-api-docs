## Should I mention or DM Selfish / SML on Discord if I have a problem?

No. We read almost all messages on the server. If you in fact have a pressing issue, you should [open an issue](https://github.com/cr-api/cr-api/issues) on Github. This ensures that we donâ€™t lose your question in the sea of Discord notifications, and make sure that someone will address the problem you are having.

You can ask your questions on Discord, however, without tagging us specifically.

## There are multiple wrappers available for (insert language here), which one should I use?

You should pick the library on your own. Wrappers that appear in our [Showcase](/showcase) are not official endorsements by the team. Use your own judgement.

## There is a wrapper available for my language already, can I write another one?

Yes, you are free to write additional wrappers and we will put it on the list when it is availble.
