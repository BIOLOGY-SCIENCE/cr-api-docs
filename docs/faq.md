## Should I mention or DM Selfish / SML on Discord if I have a problem?

No. We read almost all messages on the server. If you in fact have a pressing issue, you should [open an issue](https://github.com/cr-api/cr-api/issues) on Github. This ensures that we donâ€™t lose your question in the sea of Discord notifications, and make sure that someone will address the problem you are having.

You can ask your questions on Discord, however, without tagging us specifically.
